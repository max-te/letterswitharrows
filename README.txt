The letterswitharrows package
Copyright 2019-2021 J. M. Teegen

The letterswitharrows package provides LaTeX math-mode commands for setting left and right arrows over mathematical symbols, so that the arrows dynamically scale with the symbols.
While it is possible to set arrows over longer strings of symbols, the focus lies on single characters.

For more information, please consult the package documentation in letterswitharrows.pdf
